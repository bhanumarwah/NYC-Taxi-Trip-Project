# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Project

## Overview
This project is based on the New York City Taxi Trips. The aim is to predict the duration of the trip based on different factors like destination city, day of the week, hour of the week for assuming traffic, etc. The dataset has the following variables -
1. id - a unique identifier for each trip
2. vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record
3. pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
4. dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged
5. passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
6. pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
7. pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
8. dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
9. dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged
10.store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip
11. trip_duration - duration of the trip in seconds

Here, I have trained and tested the dataset for 3 ML Models - Regression Benchmark Model, Linear Regression and KNN Regression.
